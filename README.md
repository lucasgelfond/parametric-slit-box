Here comes another multicopter file. In the process of making my multicopter, more specifically making it look better, I decided to design a case for my PDB (power distribution board).

Frankly this can be used for anything in which you need a box with some slits in it. 

I've worked out a long of kinks since, say, the first thing I published. It's a BIT better now but I'm not quite sure how well this actually works. 

One big kink in this entire proeject is that my commits haven't registered from my account, but rather from my name (because I actually develop in OpenSCAD and push through the Github Mac app) and so there's a ton of commits for me trying to fix things, which I finally did, although most of my previous commits won't show under @lucasgelfond, but rather as "Lucas Gelfond". This is probably unimportant, but it stands. 

This is experimental and my second time ever using a for loop (in OpenSCAD, and I think probably my first SUCCESSFUL one in OpenSCAD) , being my first time using an else-if ladder (in OpenSCAD).

This is in Beta because I'm unsure of how this actually will work. Everything works for me, but I'm admittedly a bad beta tester.
